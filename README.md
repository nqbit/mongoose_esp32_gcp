# GCP ESP32 Mongoose OS Example

An example demonstrating the use of Mongoose OS (MOS) running on an ESP32, talking to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Overview

This example will delve into establishing a secure connection with MOS to GCP via MQTT. After this connection is established, a GCP Cloud Function is used to create a basic loopbackk interface to toggle on LED on the ESP32 dev board.
